# symposUCEgeneflow
Repository for scripts and some input files used in a study investigating gene flow in a subset of the members in the genus *Symposiachrus*, focusing on interactions in the *S. trivirgatus complex* and *S. guttula*. If you use something here, please cite us, or contact EFG on who is best to cite (and remind him if he forgets to update the citation):

 This README describes the scripts and data files used for a project assessing multiple aspects of gene flow in the Symposiachrus trivirgatus/guttula complex. The data were collected using Illumina sequencing for target capture of ultraconserved elements, with three main pipelines used for downstream processing. For phylogenetics, we roughly followed phyluce (https://phyluce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For anything involving a VCF, we used a pipeline based on seqcap_pop (https://github.com/mgharvey/seqcap_pop). For mitogenome analyses, MJA aligned reads to a reference mitogenome in Geneious and manually checked for inconsistencies.
